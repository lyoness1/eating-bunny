QUESTION

Prompt: 
Write a function that takes the input, gives the output, and meets the conditions below. 

Input: 
An N x M matrix of a gardent. Each cell contains an integer representing the number of carrots in that part of the garden. 

Output: 
The number of carrots Bunny eats before falling asleep. 

Conditions: 
Bunny starts in the center of the garden. 
If there are more than one center cell, Bunny starts in the cell with the largest number of carrorts. 
There will never be a tie for the highest number of carrots in a center cell. 
Bunny eats all of the carrots in his cell, then looks left, right, up, and down for more carrots. 
Bunny always moves to the adjacent cell with the highest carrot count. 
If there are no adjacent cells with carrots, Bunny falls asleep. 


ASSESSMENT

Looking for: 
- Communication
- Problem solving
- Coding ability

Things to consider:
- How well do they communicate verbally what they are thinking? 
- Do they ask clarifying questions if they don't understand something? 
- Do they stop to think before answering, or do they jump straight to code before considering options? 
- Do the write tests, or test cases, before writing code?
- Do they consider edge cases that might need to be accounted for?
- Are they able to complete a solution, at least in pseudo code? Are they able to complete a working solution?
- Can they comment on the runtime analysis of their solution?
- Do they have any ideas for how to improve the runtime of their solution? What about memory space considerations?
- Do they chose a language that is useful for our company? 
- Do they write functional or object oriented code? 
- Do they choose appropriate and readable names for variables and methods? 
- Is code extracted into small pieces, or does the solution read like a complicated story? 


NOTES

From personal experience, **most** candidates will not be able to code a working solution to this in 60 minutes time. If they do, they are probably an experienced programmer. If they code an elegent solution in under and hour, they are a very qualified candidate. 

It should not harm a candidate, if they are not able to find a solution during the interview. It's more important to gauge the candidates ability to communicate, problem sove, and code cleanly.
